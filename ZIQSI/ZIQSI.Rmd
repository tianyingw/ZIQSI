## Introduction

The **ZIQSI** R package is designed to provide advanced statistical tools for quantile curve fitting and average quantile effect calculation. This package includes two main functions:

- `proposed.nonsmooth.spline`: A function for fitting a non-smooth spline to data.
- `AQE`: A function for calculating average quantile effect based on input data and model.

This document provides an overview of the package, how to install it, and examples of how to use these functions.

## Installation

To install the **ZIQSI** package from GitHub, you can use the following code:

```{r}
# If devtools is not already installed, install it first
# install.packages("devtools")

# Install the ZIQSI package from GitHub
