We provide a tool for fitting and doing hypothesis testing for zero-inflated microbiome data given covariates of interest.
## Description
This R document provides a 
## Usage
You first need to load "functions.R" and install R packages: "MASS", "aod", "lme4", "PearsonDS". We describe the data generation and how to conduct pseudo-simulation extrapolation method for given dataset in "main.R". After running the "main.R", you can obtain the estimated quantile curve for a set of given covariates, and the p-value for hypothesis testing.
